# Debris Disk Simulation

A debris disk is a collection of dust particles orbiting a solar system older than 10Myrs. These dust particles are the remnants of planetesimal collisions within the solar system, collisions that lead to planet formation according to the core accretion model.

Since the debris are the results of planet formation, and since the dust particles are gravitationally perturbed by the solar system, analyzing a debris disk can give crucial information on the presence of exoplanets within the system.

In this project, 3-dimensional rendering techniques are used to visualize the morphologies of a debris disk orbiting a solar system composed of a single planet, with a possibly eccentric orbit. Building up on the work of Lee & Chiang (2016), a more performant and practical tool is presented to understand the various shapes of a debris disk at different viewing angles, in both scattered light and thermal emission.
